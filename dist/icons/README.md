# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Transparent background recommended
- Should be recognizable at small sizes
- Follow Chrome's design guidelines

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software like:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Figma (free)
- Canva (free)

## Temporary Icons

For testing purposes, you can create simple colored squares or use placeholder images. The extension will work without these icons, but they improve the user experience.

## Example Icon Creation

If you don't have icons ready, you can create simple ones using online tools or create basic colored squares with the extension name.
